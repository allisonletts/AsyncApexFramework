## Source
This repo is just a converted version of the code found [in this blog post](https://www.jitendrazaa.com/blog/salesforce/framework-to-fix-governor-limit-of-100-jobs-in-flex-queue/#more-6836) which is uses a [gist as the source](https://gist.github.com/JitendraZaa/305c5d409183dd061893deff0282982d#file-anonynousapex-cls).

I'm setting this up as a repo so that I can find it again later by searching GH.

## Maintenance
The only changes that are likely to be made here are for easier deployment, like a deploy button.
